## 1. How do you create a collapsible markdown section?
<details><summary>Click me</summary>
<p>
The entire section is describe by a _details_ tag, followed
by a clickable element within a _summary tag_, and lastly ending in a _paragraph_
tag. ie:

  &lt;details>&lt;summary>click me&lt;/summary>
    &lt;p>
      content
    &lt;/p>
  &lt;/details>

You can also include code blocks using triple back ticks ```

 ```javascript
let theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));
if (!Number.isNaN(theNumber)) {
  console.log("Your number is the square root of " +
              theNumber * theNumber);
}
```

</p>
</details>


## 2. What are side effects? 

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>
<p>
If a javascript statement changes the world in some way, those changes are called side effects.

It could display something on the screen—that counts as changing the world—or it could change the internal state of the machine in a way that will affect the statements that come after it.
Statements that only return values and don't otherwise change the world are said to have no side effects.
